# Linnworks x Square Integration

This is a purpose built tool (for a good friend of mine) that allows inventory and order syncing between Linnworks and Square. It also provides a simple dashboard for extra visibility.

As the name suggests, `go-lsi` has been built with Golang.

## Features
* Syncing of Inventory and Services from Linnworks to Square,
* Syncing of Orders from Square to Linnworks,
* A recurring job that starts syncing every 10',
* Simple dashboard for admins to trigger syncing and view inventory and orders,
* A RESTful API for programmatic access,

## API
These are the RESTful endpoints that the app exposes for programmatic access. Endpoints denoted with ðŸ”’, are protected and they require a `Bearer` token.
```
ðŸ”’ GET /api/v1/ping
ðŸ”’ GET api/v1/inventory - Params (at least one required): ?sku=string&barcode=string
ðŸ”’ GET /api/v1/orders
ðŸ”’ GET /api/v1/sync/status
ðŸ”’ POST /api/v1/sync/recent
ðŸ”’ POST /api/v1/sync - Body: {"start": "datetime", "end": "datetime"}
POST /api/v1/auth - Body: {"username": "string", "password": "string"}
```

A Postman collection is provided at `files/postman`.
